# Predicting Airbnb Prices and Ratings

With over 4 million listings in 191 different countries, Airbnb has become an amazing investment opportunity for people all around the world. While it is a remarkable achievement, the supply side continues to grow, which can make being an Airbnb host difficult. What can a host do to allow their listing to stand out and ultimately increase their revenue? This analysis aims to understand the most important factors for predicting  the prices and ratings for every listing in San Francisco.

Airbnb would benefit from using this analysis by being able to advise their hosts on the most important factors that lead to higher ratings and higher prices. By understanding the most important factors for price, a host could optimize their listing to increase their revenue. By understanding the factors for ratings, AirBnBâ€™s host would be able to create a better experience for Airbnb customers, who will be more willing to use the service again, while fostering positive communication around booking with AirBnB.
